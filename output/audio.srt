1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 Did you hear about Google's latest AI announcement?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,680
 It's pretty incredible.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,460
 Oh, really? What's new?

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,060
 Another language model or something similar?

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,260
 Even better.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,340
 They've unveiled a new AI model called Gemini TTS

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,940
 that can generate incredibly realistic human speech.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,140
 Wow, realistic speech?

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,900
 That's a significant leap.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,480
 What exactly can it do?

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,140
 Apparently, it can synthesize voices for different speakers

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,100
 and even generate audio in multiple languages.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,000
 Experts are genuinely impressed by the quality.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,700
 That sounds amazing for things like audio books or voice assistants,

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,640
 but I can't help but think about potential downsides.

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,440
 You're right.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,480
 Some experts are raising concerns about misuse.

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,080
 The potential for creating deep fakes or spreading misinformation

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,680
 is definitely a worry.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,580
 That's exactly what I was thinking.

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,140
 It's always a double-edged sword with these powerful new technologies.

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,320
 The ethical implications are huge.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,440
 Absolutely.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,080
 It's part of Google's bigger push in AI,

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,780
 and while the tech is impressive,

26
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,180
 the conversation around responsible use will be critical.
