1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
 Do you know there's an animal that can theoretically live forever?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,540
 Wait, seriously?

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,340
 That sounds like something out of a fantasy novel.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,440
 What is it?

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,540
 It's not a mythical beast at all, but a tiny jellyfish known as the Immortal Jellyfish.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,780
 Its scientific name is Turatopsis Dorny.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,380
 An immortal jellyfish?

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,020
 That's incredible!

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,920
 Where are these things found?

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,500
 They're found in oceans all around the world.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,060
 And what makes them immortal is their remarkable survival skill.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,380
 What kind of skill are we talking about?

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,640
 When faced with old age, injury, or even starvation, it doesn't just die.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:53,840
 It can reverse its entire life cycle, transforming back into its earliest stage, a polyp.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,240
 So it just becomes a baby again?

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,120
 That's wild!

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,100
 Does it then grow into a new jellyfish?

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,600
 Exactly!

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,840
 From that polyp, a new, genetically identical jellyfish will eventually grow!

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,840
 Imagine a butterfly being able to turn back into a caterpillar and start its life all

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
 over again!

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
 Wow!

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,360
 That's such a perfect analogy!

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,920
 So scientists must be really interested in this, right?

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,400
 Absolutely!

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,160
 This unique ability to essentially cheat death has fascinated them.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,680
 They're studying it closely to unlock secrets about aging.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,840
 That makes sense.

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,280
 A tiny creature deep in the ocean holding a potential key to immortality.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
 That's a pretty big deal.

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,960
 Now I know.
